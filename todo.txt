1. write all benchmark test functions

2. compare with nsga2-c, ecj, moea-framework, jemtal, paradiseo
3. fine tune the data saving script save_plots.m -- later
4. test betaq computation with bsxfun in real_cross, also couple of other 
    statements that may be optimized with bsxfun -- later
5. vectorize the functions in 'rand' -- later
